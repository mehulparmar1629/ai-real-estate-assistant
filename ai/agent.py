        Process a user query and generate a response using the LangChain agent.
        
        This method constructs a dynamic prompt with conversation history,
        passes it to the LangChain agent, and handles the response. The agent
        uses its understanding of real estate concepts combined with data analysis
        capabilities to generate relevant answers.
        
        The method:
        1. Formats the conversation history
        2. Constructs a dynamic prompt with system message, history, and current query
        3. Runs the LangChain agent to get an answer
        4. Updates the conversation history with the new Q&A pair
        5. Handles any exceptions that may occur during processing
        
        Parameters:
            query (str): The user's question or request about real estate
            
        Returns:

        Format the conversation history into a string for context in the prompt.
        
        This private helper method converts the stored conversation history
        (a list of dictionaries with 'User' and 'Assistant' keys) into a
        formatted string that can be included in the prompt to the LLM.
        
        The conversation history provides context for the current query,
        allowing the agent to maintain continuity and coherence across
        multiple interactions. This enables multi-turn conversations where
        the agent can refer to previously discussed properties or preferences.
