## Overview
The AI Real Estate Assistant is a conversational AI application designed to help real estate agencies assist potential buyers and renters in finding their ideal properties. The application uses natural language processing and machine learning to understand user preferences and recommend suitable properties from a database.

For detailed project requirements and specifications, see the [Product Requirements Document](PRD.MD).

## Solution Architecture & Design Decisions

### Technical Solution Overview

The AI Real Estate Assistant implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that combines the strengths of large language models with structured property data to provide intelligent property recommendations through natural conversation.

| Component | Implementation | Why We Chose It |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Large Language Models | OpenAI GPT / Llama | Provides natural language understanding and human-like responses with reasoning capabilities |
| Data Processing | Pandas | Industry-standard for handling tabular data with powerful querying and transformation features |
| Vector Embeddings | FastEmbed | Efficient, lightweight embedding generation for semantic search capabilities |
| Vector Storage | DocArrayInMemorySearch, ChromaDB | In-memory solution for quick retrieval in demonstration environments |
| Conversation Chain | ConversationalRetrievalChain | Maintains context across multiple turns of conversation with memory |
| Web Interface | Streamlit | Rapid development of interactive web applications with minimal code |

### System Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**:
   - CSV data is loaded and normalized using Pandas
   - Properties are transformed into vector embeddings using FastEmbed
   - Embeddings are stored in a vector database for efficient similarity search

2. **Conversation Handling**:
   - User queries are processed through the LLM to extract preferences
   - Preferences are used to query the property database
   - Results are formatted and presented in a conversational manner

3. **Retrieval Enhancement**:
   - V2 implements RAG to combine retrieved property information with LLM generation
   - This produces more relevant and accurate responses than pure LLM generation

## Features
- **Natural Language Conversation**: Engage users in a natural conversation about their property preferences
- **Property Search & Filtering**: Search properties based on location, budget, type, features, and more
- **Multiple Data Sources**: Support for local CSV files and external data sources via URLs
- **Flexible LLM Integration**: Support for OpenAI GPT models and open-source alternatives
- **Responsive Web Interface**: Easy-to-use Streamlit-based user interface

## Strengths & Limitations

### Strengths
1. **Natural Interaction**: Users can express preferences in natural language without learning complex search interfaces
2. **Contextual Understanding**: System remembers previous interactions and builds cumulative understanding of user needs
3. **Flexible Integration**: Works with various data sources and LLM providers, avoiding vendor lock-in
4. **Explainable Recommendations**: Provides reasons why specific properties match user criteria
5. **Rapid Development**: Architecture allows fast iteration and feature addition

### Limitations
1. **Data Dependency**: Quality of recommendations depends heavily on the completeness and accuracy of property data
2. **Cold Start Challenges**: Without sufficient initial information, recommendations may be too broad
3. **Performance Issues**: Current implementation has a "db freeze" issue during heavy processing
4. **Limited Visualization**: Currently text-based with limited visual property representation
5. **Scaling Concerns**: In-memory vector store may face challenges with very large property databases

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: Python (3.11+)
- **AI/ML**: LangChain, OpenAI GPT models, Llama models
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, FastEmbed
- **Vector Storage**: DocArrayInMemorySearch, ChromaDB

### Alternative Approaches Considered

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Why We Chose Our Approach |
|----------|------|------|---------------------------|
| Traditional Search Interface | Simpler implementation, faster queries | Limited understanding of complex preferences, requires user training | Our conversational approach provides better user experience and more intuitive interaction |
| Pure LLM Without RAG | Simpler architecture, fewer components | Hallucinations, less accurate property details | RAG provides factual grounding and prevents misinformation |
| SQL Database Only | Mature technology, optimized queries | Limited semantic understanding, rigid query structure | Vector database enables similarity search based on semantic meaning |
| External API Integration | Access to real-time data | Dependency on third-party services, potential costs | Local CSV processing provides control and predictability for demonstrations |

## Demo Highlights & Talking Points

When presenting this solution, focus on:

1. **Natural Conversation Flow**: Show how users can express complex requirements naturally
   - Example: "I need a 2-bedroom apartment in the city center with a parking space under $1500"

2. **Preference Refinement**: Demonstrate how the system narrows recommendations as users provide more details
   - Example: Start broad with "apartments in Warsaw" then refine with budget, amenities, etc.

3. **Context Retention**: Highlight how the assistant remembers previous statements
   - Example: User asks about parking after discussing a property, system knows which property they're referring to

4. **Reasoning Capabilities**: Show how it explains why properties match criteria
   - Example: "This property matches 90% of your criteria: it has the parking and 2 bedrooms you wanted, though it's slightly above your budget"

5. **Technical Architecture**: Briefly explain the RAG approach and how it prevents hallucinations

## Data Format
The application uses CSV datasets with the following structure. Datasets can be loaded from local files or remote URLs.

| Performance Optimization | Result caching and parallelization | Implementing caching strategies to avoid redundant computations |

### Code Architecture Principles

1. **Modularity**: Separation of concerns between data loading, AI processing, and user interface
   ```python
   # Example from data/csv_loader.py
   def load_csv_data(file_path: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
       """Load and normalize CSV data from a file path"""
       # Implementation follows Single Responsibility Principle
   ```

2. **Extensibility**: Designed for easy addition of new data sources or AI models
   ```python
   # Example from ai/agent.py
   class PropertyAgent:
       """Base agent class that can be extended with different LLM implementations"""
       # Implementation follows Open/Closed Principle
   ```

3. **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration via environment variables and config files
   ```python
   # Example from common/cfg.py
   def get_api_key() -> str:
       """Retrieve API key from environment with appropriate fallbacks"""
       # Implementation follows best security practices
   ```

4. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with graceful degradation
   ```python
   # Example strategy for handling API failures
   try:
       # Attempt primary model
   except Exception:
       # Fall back to alternative model or cached results
   ```

5. **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests for core components with integration testing for end-to-end flows
