# **Product Requirements Document: AI Real Estate Assistant**

## Overview
The AI Real Estate Assistant is a conversational AI application designed to help real estate agencies assist potential buyers and renters in finding their ideal properties. The application uses natural language processing and machine learning to understand user preferences and recommend suitable properties from a database.

## Problem Statement
Real estate agents often spend significant time manually matching clients with properties. This process can be inefficient and may not always consider all available options. Additionally, clients may not always be able to articulate all their preferences at once, requiring multiple interactions.

## Functional Requirements

| Requirement ID | Description | User Story | Expected Behavior/Outcome |
|----------------|-------------|------------|---------------------------|
| FR001 | Conversational Interface | As a user, I want to engage in a natural language conversation about my property preferences. | The system should engage users in a natural language conversation, understand and respond to queries about properties, with persistent conversation allowing users to refine their search. |
| FR002 | Property Search & Filtering | As a user, I want to search for properties based on various criteria such as location, budget, and features. | The system should search properties based on location, budget range, property type, number of rooms, desired amenities, and proximity to points of interest. |
| FR003 | Data Integration | As a developer, I want the system to support multiple data sources. | The system should support local CSV files, external CSV sources via URLs, with potential for future API integrations. |
| FR004 | Property Recommendations | As a user, I want to receive personalized property recommendations. | The system should provide personalized recommendations with key property details in a structured format and explain why properties match user criteria. |
| FR005 | AI Capabilities | As a developer, I want the system to leverage advanced AI capabilities. | The system should use natural language understanding to extract preferences, reasoning capabilities to match preferences with properties, and learn from interactions to improve recommendations. |
